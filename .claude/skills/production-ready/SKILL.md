# Production Ready Skill

You are the **Production Readiness Specialist** for this project.

Your mission is to take an incomplete or work-in-progress application and systematically prepare it for production deployment. This involves comprehensive analysis, testing, fixing, and validation across all features.

---

## Core Philosophy

1. **Leave No Stone Unturned**: Every feature, job, process, and component must be analyzed
2. **Test Everything**: Use both unit/feature tests (Pest) AND visual/UI tests (Playwright)
3. **Document as You Go**: Track all tasks in taskmanager for detailed progress tracking
4. **Commit Frequently**: Never lose work - commit and push after significant changes
5. **Verify Thoroughly**: At the end, re-analyze and retest everything to ensure production readiness

---

## Phase 1: Initial Commit (Safety First)

Before starting any analysis or changes:

1. **Check for uncommitted changes**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **If there are uncommitted changes**, commit them immediately:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: save work before production readiness audit"
   git push
   ```

3. This ensures we can always revert if problems arise

---

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

### 2.1 Project Structure Discovery

Use Glob and Grep to understand the project:

- Identify the framework (Laravel, React, Vue, etc.)
- Map the directory structure
- Find configuration files
- Locate tests, migrations, routes, controllers, models

### 2.2 Feature Inventory

Create a complete inventory of:

| Category | What to Find |
|----------|--------------|
| **Routes** | All API and web routes |
| **Controllers** | All controller classes and methods |
| **Models** | All database models and relationships |
| **Jobs** | All queue jobs and scheduled tasks |
| **Commands** | All artisan/CLI commands |
| **Migrations** | Database schema changes |
| **Components** | UI components (Livewire, Vue, React, etc.) |
| **Services** | Business logic services |
| **Policies** | Authorization policies |
| **Middleware** | Request middleware |
| **Events/Listeners** | Event system components |

### 2.3 Dependency Analysis

- Check for outdated dependencies
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Note deprecated package usage

---

## Phase 3: TaskManager Integration

**CRITICAL**: Use taskmanager to track all work

### 3.1 Initialize TaskManager

If not already initialized:
```
/taskmanager:init
```

### 3.2 Create Comprehensive Task Plan

For each feature/component discovered, create tasks:

```
/taskmanager:plan
```

The plan should include:
- Analysis tasks for each feature
- Testing tasks (Pest + Playwright)
- Fix tasks for identified issues
- Verification tasks

### 3.3 Task Categories

Structure tasks hierarchically:

1. **Analysis Tasks**
   - 1.1 Analyze Models
   - 1.2 Analyze Controllers
   - 1.3 Analyze Jobs
   - etc.

2. **Testing Tasks**
   - 2.1 Unit Tests (Pest)
   - 2.2 Feature Tests (Pest)
   - 2.3 UI Tests (Playwright)
   - 2.4 Integration Tests

3. **Fix Tasks**
   - 3.x Fix issues discovered during testing

4. **Verification Tasks**
   - 4.1 Final Pest test suite run
   - 4.2 Final Playwright flow tests
   - 4.3 Production checklist verification

---

## Phase 4: Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Pest Testing

For each component:

1. **Check existing tests**:
   ```bash
   php artisan test --filter=ComponentName
   ```

2. **Identify missing test coverage**:
   - Use `/test-specialist:analyze-coverage` if available
   - Check for untested public methods
   - Identify edge cases

3. **Create missing tests**:
   - Follow Pest 4 conventions
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Test authorization and validation

4. **Run and verify**:
   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```

### 4.2 Playwright UI Testing

For each user-facing feature:

1. **Navigate to the page**:
   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to the URL
   ```

2. **Take a snapshot**:
   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
   ```

3. **Verify expected elements appear**:
   - Check all expected UI elements are present
   - Verify data is displayed correctly
   - Check responsive behavior

4. **Test interactions**:
   - Click buttons and links
   - Fill forms
   - Submit data
   - Verify results

5. **Test user flows**:
   - Complete workflows end-to-end
   - Test error handling
   - Verify redirects and navigation

### 4.3 Test Documentation

For each test:
- Document what is being tested
- Note any issues found
- Track fixes needed

---

## Phase 5: Issue Resolution

### 5.1 Categorize Issues

| Priority | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Critical** | App crashes, data loss, security | Fix immediately |
| **High** | Features don't work | Fix before production |
| **Medium** | Works but has problems | Should fix |
| **Low** | Minor issues, cosmetic | Nice to fix |

### 5.2 Fix Process

For each issue:

1. Create a task in taskmanager
2. Implement the fix
3. Write/update tests for the fix
4. Run all related tests
5. Commit the fix:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: description of what was fixed"
   git push
   ```

---

## Phase 6: Final Verification

### 6.1 Complete Test Suite

Run the full test suite:
```bash
php artisan test
```

All tests MUST pass.

### 6.2 Playwright Flow Testing

For each major user flow:

1. **Authentication flow**:
   - Register, login, logout, password reset

2. **Core business flows**:
   - CRUD operations for main entities
   - Key user journeys

3. **Admin flows**:
   - Dashboard access
   - User management
   - Settings

4. **Error handling**:
   - 404 pages
   - Validation errors
   - Permission denied

### 6.3 Production Checklist

Verify each item:

- [ ] All tests passing (Pest)
- [ ] All UI flows working (Playwright)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No PHP errors or warnings
- [ ] Database migrations are up to date
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Caching configured
- [ ] Queue workers configured
- [ ] Scheduled tasks configured
- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Security headers in place
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS ready
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Backup strategy documented

---

## Phase 7: Documentation

### 7.1 Update README

Ensure documentation includes:
- Installation instructions
- Configuration requirements
- Deployment steps
- Common issues and solutions

### 7.2 Final Report

Generate a summary:
- Total features analyzed
- Tests added/fixed
- Issues found and resolved
- Known limitations
- Recommendations

---

## Commit Strategy

Throughout the process:

| When | Commit Message Pattern |
|------|------------------------|
| Before starting | `chore: save work before production readiness audit` |
| After analysis phase | `docs: complete feature inventory and analysis` |
| After each test batch | `test: add tests for [component]` |
| After each fix | `fix: [what was fixed]` |
| After final verification | `chore: production readiness audit complete` |

Always push after committing:
```bash
git push
```

---

## Error Handling

If you encounter issues:

1. **Test failures**: Analyze the failure, fix the code OR the test
2. **Missing dependencies**: Install them and document
3. **Configuration issues**: Fix and document the correct settings
4. **Playwright issues**: Check browser installation, retry with delays

Never leave the app in a broken state. If you can't fix something, document it clearly and mark it as a known issue.

---

## Output

At the end of the process, provide:

1. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Features analyzed: X
   - Tests added: X
   - Tests fixed: X
   - Issues found: X
   - Issues resolved: X

2. **Remaining Issues** (if any):
   - Description
   - Priority
   - Recommended action

3. **Production Readiness Status**:
   - READY: All checks pass
   - READY WITH NOTES: Minor issues documented
   - NOT READY: Critical issues remain

---

## Integration with Other Tools

This skill works best when combined with:

- **taskmanager**: For detailed task tracking (`/taskmanager:plan`, `/taskmanager:run`)
- **test-specialist**: For Pest test generation
- **code:cleanup**: For cleaning code before commits

Use these tools proactively throughout the process.
